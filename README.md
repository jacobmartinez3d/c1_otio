# Real-Time Adobe Premiere Timeline Shotlog

Using Node.js, Flask, React, and OpentimelineIO. The Node server will run at:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
It will render a real-time html shot-log generated by data from a *Final Cut Pro XML* file exported from Premiere. The html page will auto-update in your browser any time the XML file is re-exported.

It will also translate any clip markers from the Premiere timeline with the following naming:

![Alt text](./img/premiere_marker.png?raw=true "C1 Login popup dialogue.")

The ***[VFX]*** is a tag that will tell the server to include it on the Shot Log as a *VFX Note*.

The Shot Log will look like this:

![Alt text](./img/shotlog.png?raw=true "C1 Login popup dialogue.")

Other computers in your network can also access it in a browser by typing your IP address followed by ***:3000*** (which means port 3000).

Example:
```
192.168.0.1:3000
```
