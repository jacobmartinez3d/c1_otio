# Real-Time Adobe Premiere Timeline Shot-log

Built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [OpentimelineIO](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO).

There are 2 servers that run simultaneously:

#### **Node**
A front end built with React serving a shot-log generated by data from a *Final Cut Pro XML* file.

#### **Flask**
A Python server that watches the xml file and converts it to the OpenTimelineIO format **otio** whenever it's been re-exported.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Install Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Install Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/1.0.2/)
* [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then, Clone this repo and navigate a command prompt to its directory.

#### Start the Flask server:
Type:
```
flask run
```
Then, open a 2nd command prompt and navigate again to the "c1_otio/" folder.
#### Start the Node server:
Type:
```
npm start
```

#### Open a web browser
And navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Export a new timeline
To save a new shot-log, you just save over the existing timeline.xml located in your "c1_otio/src/OTIO/" directory.
#### Example:
`E:\c1_otio\src\OTIO\timeline.xml`

![Alt text](./img/premiere_export.png?raw=true "Export a FCP XML")

It must be named timeline.xml

#### To leave VFX notes
You just [create a marker on a clip](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/markers.html) by pressing "m" with the track selected. Then edit the marker from the "Window/Markers" panel.

Name the marker with "**[VFX]**" as a prefix. The message will then be included in the shot-log in the "VFX Notes" column.

#### Example:

![Alt text](./img/premiere_marker.png?raw=true "Leave notes for the shot-log.")

The shot-log will auto-update in your browser any time the XML file changes.

Other computers in your network can also access it in a browser by typing your IP address followed by ***:3000*** (which means port 3000).

Example:
```
192.168.0.1:3000
```
