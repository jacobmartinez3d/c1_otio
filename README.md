# Real-Time Adobe Premiere Timeline Shotlog

Built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [OpentimelineIO](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO).

There are 2 servers that run simultaneously:

#### **Node, React**
A app serving a real-time html shot-log generated by data from a *Final Cut Pro XML* file - including [clip markers](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/markers.html) in Premiere. The html page will auto-update in your browser any time the XML file changes.

#### **Flask**
A Python server that watches the xml file and converts it to the OpenTimelineIO format **otio** whenever it's been re-exported.

## From Premiere
To leave VFX notes you just create a marker on a clip, and name the marker with "**[VFX]**" as a prefix. Then, you can leave a message which will be added to the shot log.

#### Example:

![Alt text](./img/premiere_marker.png?raw=true "C1 Login popup dialogue.")

#### Exporting the timeline
